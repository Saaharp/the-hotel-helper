# The Hotel Helper
This application allows hotel employees to get immediate answers to common questions about their job. Each user has the ability to search for topics, create new topics, and update or delete their inputs.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, Node.js

## Optimizations:
Incorporate a comprehensive dashboard with integrated APIs to provide hotel employees with real-time access to relevant information such as current weather updates, personalized "things to do" recommendations, and restaurant reviews for guests.

Implement a messaging component within the app that enables managers and supervisors to create and escalate tasks to employees, who can then accept and resolve these tasks upon completion.
